## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is probably my toughest one yet in getting the exact spacing right, however I think I really need to go back through the CSS and refactor it.  I tried to go for a mobile first CSS design this time to test see what is better fit for myself in terms of development and must say I did struggle a bit however getting it to fit desktop then was a lot easier.

### Continued development

There are a lot of areas I still need to work on - one being the tables, whilst I can do the tables I could have likely styled it a lot easier.
